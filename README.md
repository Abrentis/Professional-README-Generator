## Description
As a developed who is constantly working on new projects, one process that I find myself repeating the most is creating README.md files. I always format my README's the same way, and it is time consuming having to whip them up with scratch without a template. To combat this nuisance, I have developed an application that prompts the user with a series of questions, and, based on the input from the user, creates a README.md file with the format I constantly use. This saves me time having to create them from scratch, and it gave me a taste of what it's like to quickly create a file through automation versus my own time and labor.
